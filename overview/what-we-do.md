# 💡 What we do

At **CardFi**, we bridge the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world utility by enabling **decentralized, encrypted prepaid card issuance** across multiple blockchain networks.

### 🌐 Our Core Mission

We empower users to **spend their crypto assets like cash** — anywhere, anytime — by issuing prepaid cards backed by DeFi assets. With CardFi, DeFi becomes not just an investment vehicle, but a real-world financial tool.

***

### 🔧 What We Provide

#### 1. **Decentralized Prepaid Card Infrastructure**

CardFi offers a permissionless protocol that allows anyone to issue encrypted prepaid cards directly on-chain — no centralized custody, no KYC barriers.

#### 2. **Multi-chain Compatibility**

Our smart contracts and issuance infrastructure are deployed across major blockchain ecosystems:

* Ethereum
* Binance Smart Chain
* Arbitrum
* Base
* Solana

This allows users from any supported chain to access prepaid card services without migrating assets.

#### 3. **Real-world Spending Enablement**

We integrate with fiat off-ramp and settlement services to allow seamless use of DeFi assets for:

* Physical and online card payments
* ATM withdrawals
* Real-time asset conversion for everyday purchases

***

### 🔒 Encrypted & Private by Default

Every CardFi-issued prepaid card is **encrypted by design**, with support for anonymous usage and integration with privacy-focused ecosystems such as **Monero (XMR)** via our [Moneropan Bot](http://t.me/moneropan_bot).
